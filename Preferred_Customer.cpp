// // A retail store has a preferred customer plan where customers may earn discounts on
// all their purchases. The amount of a customer’s discount is determined by the amount
// of the customer’s cumulative purchases in the store.
// //The purchaseAmount variable holds the total of a customer’s purchases to date. The
// discountLevel variable should be set to the correct discount percentage, according to
// the store’s preferred customer plan. Write appropriate member functions for this class
// and demonstrate it in a simple program.
